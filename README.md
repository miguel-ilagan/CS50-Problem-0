# CS50-Problem-0
Scratch project - Guess the number

This is my Scratch project for Problem 0 of Harvard's CS50x course!

The project is a simple 'Guess the number' game where the user tries and guesses the number randomly generated by a computer.
In the game, the user specifies the range to which the computer will randomly generate its number.

If you guess the number correctly then you win!

If you guess the number incorrectly then you lose!
